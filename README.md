# Supaero robotics, 2023

This repository contains the exercices for the robotics class at Supaero, 2023.
The exercices are organized by notebook. Each notebook corresponds to one chapter of the class.
The notebooks are in Python and based on the software [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio).

## Set up

### Linux, Python 3, PyPI

On a Linux system with Python 3, you can get the dependencies directly with +[pip (see installation procedure and update below)](#installing-pip):
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


NB: you should consider using a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Once you have the dependencies, you can start the server with `jupyter notebook`

### Docker

On other systems, use use the virtualization provided by +Docker. A Docker image is provided, and can be started with:

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -p 7000:7000 -p 7001:7001 -p 7002:7002 -p 7003:7003 -p 7004:7004 -p 8888:8888 -v data:/home/user/tp -it gepetto/supaero
```

On Linux host systems, you may simply start the Docker with:

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --net host -v data:/home/user/tp -it gepetto/supaero
```

In case of big update, you must update the docker:
```bash
sudo docker pull gepetto/supaero
```

### Update the notebooks

If the repository changes (for example when new tutorials are pushes), you need to update your local
version by "pulling" it from the repository.
On a native installation, just go in the folder containing the tutorials and execute ```git pull```

With a docker, execute the following:
```bash
sudo docker run --rm -v data:/home/user/tp -it gepetto/supaero  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/gepetto/supaero2023
```
Then
```bash
sudo docker run --rm -v data:/home/user/tp -it gepetto/supaero  git pull --rebase origin main
```

To avoid conflict when pulling a new version, you should better to your modifications in copy of the original files,
not directly in the original files itself.

## Side notes

### Installing pip

Pip is a tool for installing and managing Python packages. You can install it with

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

The default version of +pip installed by +apt is not up to date, so upgrade it with
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user
```

In general, running +pip is likely to run an alias on +pip in /usr, so either run it through python3 as explained above, or make sure your path select the right pip executable in your ~/.local. The option --user is kind of optional for recent +pip version, but removing it should work with a warning.

### Installing docker

On linux, install docker with +apt (or see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```
On other OS, see [how to get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
